Text Clustering with K-Means and PCA
This repository contains code for a simple text clustering project using the K-Means algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization. The project showcases the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and clustering.

Overview
The project demonstrates the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries.
Defining sample text data.
Text preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF.
Dimensionality reduction using PCA (optional, for visualization).
Clustering using K-Means.
Visualizing the clustered data.
Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed to run the project:

pandas,
scikit-learn,
matplotlib,
numpy
